    there are some methods but they are referencing another method behind the scene inside of the jQuery file. (blur - focus - focusin - focusout - load - scrool - unload - click (remember this?) - dblclick). In this case, this is the on method we are talking about.

    before it was used to done like -> $('h2').bind('click')
    we should not use these methods anymore (the methods are on the title) because all of them are referencing the [on] method. (after jquery-1.7)

      $('h2').bind('click',function(){
      console.log('on click with bind method!')

    but with this, you are attaching an event handler for each of the elements you have a match with. For example if there were 8 h2 tags, it means we would have had 8 event handlers, which is not we want due to performance!

    the other negative point with this bind method; after we updated the DOM, those updated elements will not recieve the event handlers we attached!

      $('h2').bind('click',function(){
      console.log('clicked with bind!');
        //these two lines below just to show what it grabs
        //var cloned = $(this).clone();
        //console.log(cloned);
      $(this).clone().appendTo('body'); //<- can be appended to ('#container'), ('document.body') which is the same thing we are doing here

        //this new h2 that we append will not carry the bind method on it because of the way how code works. in terms of top-to-bottom remember!! but...

      to get around it, you can pass an argument to the clone wheter or not you want to clone the handlers as well. default is [false].
      $('h2').bind('click', function(){
      $(this).clone(true).appendTo('body');

      later on, .live() introduced. live implements event delegation. so instead of adding event handlers to each of the elements that match (in our case this element is h2), live attaches the event to the document. so click event is attached to the document. later on we are going to detect is it an h2 element or not when click occurs. we might get an error with this on latest jquery versions because it is not detected as a function anymore! deprecated after 1.7 version.

      $('h2').live('click', function(){
      $(this).clone().appendTo('body');

      after .live(), .delegate() method was introduced (and also undelegate). so with this, what you pass to jQuery should be the context (trying to say $('h2') <- our context here is h2). delegate method served a quite a lot time though!

      $('div.container').delegate('h2','click', function(){
      $(this).clone().appendTo('.container');
      //be carefull where we append. if we append it to body like we did before, it wont work in the way we want.

      at the end of the day, all of the methods refer to .on() method! do not use any of these at all...

      if you want to find a method in a jQuery file, write the method name followed by a colon sign! (like -> toggle:)
      */

      $('div.container').delegate('h2','click', function(){
      $(this).clone().appendTo('.container');
    });
  })();
